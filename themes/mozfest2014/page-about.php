        <h4 class="intro-large">Dear Webmakers,</h4>
        <h4>Help us build a truly global web.</h4>
        <p>
          Over the next few years, billions of new Internet users will come online thanks to affordable mobile technologies. MozFest is a hands-on festival dedicated to forging the future of this open, global web. It’s our chance to dream at scale: how will we build and teach the web -  both technically and culturally -  with these billions of new users?
        </p>

        <p>
          Packed with passionate technologists and creators eager to share their skills, MozFest invites you to arrive with an idea, demo and hack on innovative digital solutions, bring a pragmatic approach to solving real problems and forge new collaborations to tackle pressing issues on the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our aim this year is to showcase and develop best practices for community leadership. Join us in discovering how distributed organizing and sharing skills through teaching and learning can build a web filled with opportunity for all!
        </p>

        <h2>Festival History</h2>
      </div>
      <h4>A History of MozFest</h4>
      <p>
        Mozfest started in 2010 as the Drumbeat Festival in Barcelona. Dedicated to finding, energizing and creating a community of people working with technology to build participation, understanding and control into Internet life, the Drumbeat Festival focused on the pillars of Mozilla at the time: working in the open, smart crowdsourcing and open innovation, and lots of local and regional communities and gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last 4 years more than 3,300 people from 51 countries have collaborated at MozFest to shape the future of the web. Join us in 2014 as we celebrate what we've achieved so far, and cast our eyes forward to what we can do next.
